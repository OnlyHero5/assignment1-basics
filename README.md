## 📘 Overview

This project is the implementation of **Assignment 1** for CS336, focusing on the **fundamental building blocks** of artificial intelligence and computational problem solving.

The main goal of this assignment is to gain practical experience with:
- Python programming fundamentals 🐍  
- Problem decomposition and modular design  
- Basic data manipulation and algorithm design  
- Version control and collaboration via Git & GitHub

````

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the main script to execute the assignment:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

You can modify the configuration or input data in the corresponding files inside `src/` or `data/`.

---

## ✅ Testing

All unit tests are located under the `tests/` directory.

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

or if `pytest` is not installed:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

Example console output for a typical run:

```
Initializing assignment...
Running algorithms...
Task 1 complete.
Task 2 complete.
All tasks successfully executed ✅
```
